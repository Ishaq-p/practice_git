# the log in and sign up software system
this system has two functionalities, one Log in and second Sign up; the meaning is obviously derived from it's names, for instance if user's username doesn't exists the software system will suggest to Sign up, which means the username is the unique value;
on contrary if the username exists the software will run the Log in function successfully.

## Sign Up
as it is mentioned above the signup function is valid for usernames that doesn't exist in the database; so how do the signup function work?
